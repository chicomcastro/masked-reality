# Masked reality

(in construction...)


I'm open to criticism, thank's for playing!

## Controls
WASD to move + mouse (left and right) to build/destroy blocks

## Source code
There's all on my GitHub, fell free to check it out!

## Assets
It's all made by me, except for font (credits for Raymond Larabie) and player controller (not yet!!)

## Looking ahead
Why not a multiplayer and big scenarious with lots of puzzles each one? Let me know if you think it deserves it!
